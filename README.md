## Information

### Features

- **Two-way integration with Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab.** Your issues will be synced with these services via api. All external changes with issues will be also synced via webhooks.
- **Automatically build changelog** Your pull requests and related issues will be parsed, sent to specified emails and wrote to repository file automatically after receiving webhooks from Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab. Our [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/technoeleganceteam/kanban_on_rails/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is built by this way, check it out!
- **Inviting users to your boards** You can invite users that have no Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab accounts to your board as managers for example, so they will not see your project code but they could see your board and issues.
- **Real-time integration** You and your team will see all changes in real time via websockets. We use great rails framework Action Cable for this.
- **Multi-project boards** You can create board with multiple projects(even from Gitlab or Github together)
- **Multi-section boards** You can divide your board to multiple sections. For example you can create section with all issues(by click to checkbox "Or include all?" while creating the section) and section with only important issues(by creating section with tag "Important" for example, all issues with tag "Important" will display there)
- **Interactive boards** You can drag and drop issues between columns, so its tags will change accordingly. You can also close issue just drop it out of a board.
- **Multi-language** Service is translated in more than 70 languages.
- **Completely open source** This servise is licensed under MIT License and you can fork this repository or do whatever you want with the code. You can also deploy this service to your own server.

### Local installation

The easiest way to install it locally is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). All you need is:

- Install Docker Engine to your OS first and then install Docker Compose.
- Pull kanban_on_rails image: ```docker pull gkopylov/kanban_on_rails:1```.
- Clone project ```git clone git@github.com:technoeleganceteam/kanban_on_rails.git```
- Copy ```config/settings.local.yml.example``` and rename it to ```config/settings.local.yml```
- Go to the project root and run ```docker-compose up```

Then open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). That's almost all. If you'd like to have integration with other services locally you need to specify your settings for these services in ```config/settings.local.yml```.

### How to deploy to your server

Currenlty this service deployed by Capistrano with Puppet provision. But you can choose different way to deploy, for example by Ansible with Docker.

### How to integrate with your own Gitlab server

If you'd like to integrate with your own Gitlab server, first you must deploy this service to your server too and then you must specify Settings.omniauth.gitlab.client_options of gitlab service. It contains 3 keys: ```site```(url of your gitlab service), ```authorize_url```(usually '/oauth/authorize') and ```token_url```(usually '/oauth/token'). After this you could sign in with your Gitlab service and use your own Gitlab service api to sync your projects. Your should alse set your Gitlab api endpoint url in ```Settings.gitlab_endpoint```.

### How to run test suite and lints

After local installation you can run specs with command ```rake spec```. You can run all specs and lints with command ```rake kanban_on_rails:run_all_specs_and_lints```. If you install it with Docker you to write ```docker-compose run web``` before, for example ```docker-compose run web rake kanban_on_rails:run_all_specs_and_lints```.
